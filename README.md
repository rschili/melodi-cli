# melodi-cli

A gentle tune that makes imodels sing and sound.

This is a command line interface (CLI) for disecting and troubleshooting imodels.

It provides a fluent interactive interface that prompts the user with a series of options to guide them through the process.
Can also be called with command line arguments which match the inputs of the options (the full call is displayed at the end of every run).

I'm using make to wrap all my commands, you can use that, or just call npm directly.
